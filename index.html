          <strong>Freddie Mercury</strong> (born
          <strong>Farrokh Bulsara</strong>; 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)
          was a British singer and songwriter, who achieved worldwide fame as
          the lead vocalist of the rock band
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)" target="_blank"
            >Queen</a
          >. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of rock
          music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and four-octave
          vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock frontman with
          his theatrical style, influencing the artistic direction of Queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock
          and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003,
          and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen
          members were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to
          British Music, and one year after his death, Mercury was awarded it
          individually. In 2005, Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for
          Outstanding Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters,
          Composers, and Authors. In 2002, Mercury was voted number 58 in the
          BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.

        <h2>Life</h2>
        <p>
          Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, Mercury attended
          English-style boarding schools in India from the age of eight and
          returned to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled
          the Zanzibar Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. Having studied
          and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_May" target="_blank"
            >Brian May</a
          >

            >Roger Taylor</a
          >. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including "Killer Queen",
          "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Somebody to Love", "We Are the Champions",
          "Don't Stop Me Now" and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love". His
          charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the
          audience, as displayed at the 1985 Live Aid concert. He also led a
          solo career and was a producer and guest musician for other artists.

          Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS in 1987. He continued to record with
          Queen, and posthumously featured on their final album, Made in Heaven
          (1995). He announced his diagnosis the day before his death, from
          complications from the disease, in 1991 at the age of 45. In 1992, a
          concert in tribute to him was held at Wembley Stadium, in benefit of
          AIDS awareness. His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018
          biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen's Greatest Hits album:
          "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Seven Seas of Rhye", "Killer Queen", "Somebody
          to Love", "Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy", "We Are the Champions",
          "Bicycle Race", "Don't Stop Me Now", "Crazy Little Thing Called Love",
          and "Play the Game". In 2003 Mercury was posthumously inducted into
          the Songwriters Hall of Fame with the rest of Queen, and in 2005 all
          four band members were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding
          Song Collection from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers,
          and Authors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often
          delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly
          theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from
          the crowd. A writer for The Spectator described him as "a performer
          out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various
          extravagant versions of himself." David Bowie, who performed at the
          Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recorded the song "Under Pressure"
          with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: "Of all the
          more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest
          ... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man
          who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he
          was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his
          hand." Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make "the
          last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that
          he was connected". Mercury's main prop on stage was a broken
          microphone stand; after accidentally snapping it off the heavy base
          during an early performance, he realised it could be used in endless
          ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to
          the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar.
          Much of the music he liked was guitar-orientated: his favourite
          artists at the time were the Who, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, David
          Bowie, and Led Zeppelin. He was often self-deprecating about his
          skills on both instruments. However Brian May states Mercury "had a
          wonderful touch on the piano. He could play what came from inside him
          like nobody else – incredible rhythm, incredible passion and feeling."
          Keyboardist Rick Wakeman praised Mercury's playing style, saying he
          "discovered [the piano] for himself" and successfully composed a
          number of Queen songs on the instrument. From the early 1980s Mercury
          began extensively using guest keyboardists. Most notably, he enlisted
          Fred Mandel (a Canadian musician who also worked for Pink Floyd, Elton
          John, and Supertramp) for his first solo project. From 1982 Mercury
          collaborated with Morgan Fisher (who performed with Queen in concert
          during the Hot Space leg), and from 1985 onward Mercury collaborated
          with Mike Moran (in the studio) and Spike Edney (in concert).

        <p>
          As well as his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and
          several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially
          successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several
          of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the UK Music Charts. His first
          solo effort goes back to 1972 under the pseudonym Larry Lurex, when
          Trident Studios' house engineer Robin Geoffrey Cable was working in a
          musical project, at the time when Queen were recording their debut
          album; Cable enlisted Mercury to perform lead vocals on the songs "I
          Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back", both were released together as a
          single in 1973. Eleven years later, Mercury contributed to the
          soundtrack for the restoration of the 1927 Fritz Lang film Metropolis.
          The song "Love Kills" was written for the film by Giorgio Moroder in
          collaboration with Mercury, and produced by Moroder and Mack; in 1984
          it debuted at the number 10 position in the UK Singles Chart.
